# friend_builder

An app to help you build deeper friendships.

## Contributing

Setting up the project should be going through the [normal steps for a flutter application](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).

Once installed, run the following to build and test the app in debug mode:

```sh
flutter test
flutter run
```


## Deploying to iOS

The application is deployed via [XCode Cloud](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/teams/ab0ee7c9-ef9e-4f78-8699-b371f4e2de2a/apps/1529389123/ci/groups) to TestFlight. Every push to `main` creates a new build that is deployable to various groups.
