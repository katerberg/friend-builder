# Cursor Rules for Friend Builder

## Dart/Flutter Conventions

### Variable Naming

- Never use abbreviated or shortened variable names
- Use full, descriptive names that clearly convey the variable's purpose
- Examples:
  - ✅ `preferences` instead of ❌ `prefs`
  - ✅ `configuration` instead of ❌ `config`
  - ✅ `database` instead of ❌ `db`
  - ✅ `repository` instead of ❌ `repo`
  - ✅ `application` instead of ❌ `app`
  - ✅ `temporaryValue` instead of ❌ `tempVal`
- Exception: Well-established abbreviations in the domain (e.g., `id`, `url`, `html`)
- Exception: Loop counters like `i`, `j`, `k` in simple loops
- This improves code readability and maintainability

### Print Statements

- Never use bare `print()` statements in production code
- Always wrap print statements in a debug-only check using `kDebugMode`
- Import `package:flutter/foundation.dart` when using `kDebugMode`
- Pattern to follow:

  ```dart
  if (kDebugMode) {
    print('Debug message here');
  }
  ```

- This ensures print statements are stripped out in release builds for better performance

### Comments

- Minimize comments in code - let the code speak for itself
- Only add comments when logic is truly complicated or unintuitive
- Never add comments that simply restate what the code does
- Avoid:
  - ❌ `// Loop through the list`
  - ❌ `// Return the result`
  - ❌ `// Set the value to true`
  - ❌ `// Initialize the controller`
- Acceptable:
  - ✅ Explaining *why* something non-obvious is done
  - ✅ Documenting workarounds for known issues or bugs
  - ✅ Clarifying complex algorithms or business logic
- Good variable/function names eliminate the need for most comments
